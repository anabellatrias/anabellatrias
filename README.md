# 👋 Hi, I'm Anabella Trias

I’m a **Data Science & AI student** at Florida International University (Class of 2026) focused on building practical, human-centered ML systems. I enjoy turning messy data into clear insights, building end-to-end pipelines, and creating tools that actually help people make better decisions.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Weak Supervision for Bottleneck Detection  
**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Streamlit, Matplotlib  

Built a validated weak-supervision pipeline to identify workflow bottlenecks with minimal labeled data.

- Engineered features such as duration variance, queue behavior, and SLA deviations  
- Designed rule-based labeling functions validated on held-out ground truth (F1=0.82)  
- Trained a Random Forest on programmatically labeled data (2k samples) achieving **F1=0.989**  
- Performed data-quality audits that corrected label encoding issues and improved downstream model performance  
- Conducted business validation using domain signals: SLA breaches, rework patterns, and throughput lift  

Demonstrates weak supervision, model validation, and handling distribution shift in applied ML.

### 🔹 Meal Deal Finder – Grocery Budgeting & Meal Planning App  
**Tools:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Spoonacular API  

Built a multi-page Streamlit app that helps users manage ingredients, generate recipes, and organize efficient grocery shopping.

- Pantry management with categories, quantities, units, and restock status  
- Recipe generation using Spoonacular based on available ingredients and dietary filters  
- Recipe book for storing user-selected options  
- Shopping cart that groups missing ingredients by store category for easy purchasing  
- Clean UI built with multi-page architecture and dataframe-based displays

### 🔹 Gold vs. S&P 500 Outperformance Prediction  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn  

Built a binary classifier to predict when gold outperforms the S&P 500 using 18 years of macroeconomic time-series data.

- Combined 12 datasets (gold prices, S&P 500, CPI, oil, federal funds rate, VIX, yields, USD index, jobs data)  
- Engineered 30+ lag features, rolling stats, volatility measures, and momentum indicators  
- Performed EDA identifying crisis periods (2008, 2020) as predictive turning points  
- Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost using proper time-based splits  
- **Logistic Regression was the top model**, achieving **76% ROC AUC**  
- Identified VIX, USD index, and treasury yields as key drivers
