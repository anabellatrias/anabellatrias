# 👋 Hi, I'm Anabella Trias

I'm a **Data Science and AI student** at Florida International University, graduating in Spring 2026. I'm passionate about using machine learning to solve real-world problems in practical and intentional ways — from building personalized recommendation systems to uncovering insights in messy data.

I care about making technology useful, understandable, and human-centered. Whether it’s working with large-scale data or fine-tuning models for better decisions, I love applying data science to make a meaningful impact.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Operational Insight – Bottleneck Prediction Platform *(Break Through Tech x Chambers Capital)*
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, PM4Py, scikit-learn, Streamlit, Matplotlib  

Developed an end-to-end data pipeline that analyzes anonymized operational event logs from small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) to **identify and predict workflow bottlenecks**.  
- Cleaned and explored 2k+ process-log events to uncover early inefficiency trends  
- Engineered features such as `duration variance`, `system load`, and `queue length`  
- Trained Decision Tree and Random Forest models to classify bottleneck events  
- Built visual dashboards and an executive playbook quantifying potential **cycle-time reductions**  

*This repository is private due to data confidentiality. A public demo version is in progress.*

### 🔹 Meal Deal Finder 
**Tools**: Python, pandas, streamlit 

A program that helps users find the most cost-effective meal combinations designed to reduce overspending by comparing individual item prices from different retailers.

## 🌱 Outside of Tech

In addition to coding and exploring AI, I enjoy:

- Volunteering with student organizations and mentoring peers  
- Cooking and trying new recipes
- Traveling and documenting trips through photos  

I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and building tech that improves lives — not just systems.
