# 👋 Hi, I'm Anabella Trias

I'm a **Data Science and AI student** at Florida International University, graduating in Spring 2026. I'm passionate about using machine learning to solve real-world problems in practical and intentional ways — from building personalized recommendation systems to uncovering insights in messy data.

I care about making technology useful, understandable, and human-centered. Whether it’s working with large-scale data or fine-tuning models for better decisions, I love applying data science to make a meaningful impact.

## 🌱 Outside of Tech

In addition to coding and exploring AI, I enjoy:

- Volunteering with student organizations and mentoring peers  
- Cooking and trying new recipes
- Traveling and documenting trips through photos  

I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and building tech that improves lives — not just systems.
